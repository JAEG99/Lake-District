            <h2>Catbells - Easy</h2>
            <p>A classic hike which features in pretty much every ‘best hikes in the lake district’ guide.
                <br>
                It does so for good reason, situated just outside of Keswick the views from the summit over Derwentwater
                and towards
                Skiddaw and Blencathra are sensational.
                <br>
                The undulating peak is easy to access and not that difficult to climb, especially when there are several
                flat sections
                which allow you to catch your breath and take in the scenery.
                <br>
                It is a recommeded first climb for many.
            </p>

            <h2>Blencathra - Hard</h2>
            <p>Blencathra, also known as Saddleback, is an iconic part of the Lake District landscape. Its distinctive
                table-top shape
                which towers above the town of Keswick makes it instantly recognisable.
                <br>
                The ascent via the notorious Sharp Edge, one of the Lake District’s most famous Grade 1 scrambles, is a
                shot but
                thrilling route which is best saved for a fine day.
                <br>
                People have died falling from this knife edge ridge so treat it with respect and only tackle it if you
                are confident
                with heights, have the appropriate footwear and in the right conditions.
                <br>

            <h2>Rannerdale Knotts - Medium</h2>
            <p>One of the less challenging walks.
                <br>
                This short loop takes you up to the summit of Rannerdale Knotts which affords you terrific views over
                Crummock Water and
                down the Buttermere valley towards Fleetwith Pike.
                <br>
                I’d recommend tackling this route in an anticlockwise direction as the climb is more gentle.
                <br>
                You will also finish off your walk off by skirting around the edge of Crummock Water, which is a
                delightfully tranquil
                spot to go for a wild swim to cool off.
                <br>
                During the spring, there is also a hidden valley of Bluebells situated behind Rannerdale Knotts which you
                can scramble
                down from the summit to visit.
                <br>
